A simple demo project using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) to render a 3D scene in the browser.

## Features

- Minimal setup with three.js via CDN
- Example of a basic 3D scene (see main.js)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/three.js-Demo.git
   cd three.js-Demo/basic
   ```

2. **Open index.html in your browser:**

   - For best results, use a local server (e.g., with Python):

     ```sh
     python3 -m http.server
     ```
     Then visit [http://localhost:8000/basic/](http://localhost:8000/basic/) in your browser.

  ├── index.html   # Main HTML file with import maps
  └── main.js      # Main JavaScript file with three.js code
```
